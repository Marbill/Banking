Banking System (C#)

Fully functional Banking system that consists of administrator menu to create savings and mutual funds accounts and a customer account menu where users can log in using their account number as passwords (not a smart thing to do in a real world app of course :P) users can perfom the usual transaction such as check balance, deposit, and withdraw from their accounts.
